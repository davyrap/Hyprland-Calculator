This calculator doesn't show any buttons since you can simply use your keyboard to operate it.
The window automatically resizes according to the length of the equation you give it.
If you click the result or press _c_ on your keyboard the result will be copied in your clipboard. The only catch is that when you close the calculator your history gets wiped.
The application also sends a notification via command _notify-send_ whenever you copy the result in your clipboard
